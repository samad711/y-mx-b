        <h1>y = mx + b</h1>
        <p>The formula is the slope-intercept form of a straight line. In the equation y = mx + b, 'b' is the point where the line will intersect the y-axis.
            <br>
            <br>The 'm' is the slope of the line. The slope (m) of the line is determined by rise/run(Fig 1). The slope will remain constant throughout the line.
            <br>
            <br>If the x or run value is 0 then the slope is undefined because it is going straight up.
            <br>If the y or rise valie is 0 then the slope is equivalent to the 'b' value. </p>
